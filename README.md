# Android Emulator Skin For Nexus 5

This is an android emulator skin for the Nexus 5. Graphics are taken from http://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/freebie-of-the-week/free-open-source-nexus-5-psd-templates (and slightly modified by me).

To install, copy this folder to 
```
ANDROID_SDK/platforms/android-VERSION/skins/NEXUS-5
```
and then select NEXUS-5 in the AVD-Editor or simply start your emulator like this:
```
emulator -avd MY_NEXUS_5_AVD -skindir ~/Downloads -skin android-emulator-skin-nexus-5
```

and this is, what it looks like:
